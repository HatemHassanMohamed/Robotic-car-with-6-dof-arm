## 🌟 Key Features

- **6-DOF Robotic Arm**  
  High dexterity for grasping, positioning, and manipulation tasks in 3D space.  

- **Mecanum Drive Base**  
  4-wheel omnidirectional movement allows simultaneous translation and rotation.  

- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**  
  Algorithmic control computes joint angles for desired coordinates: `(x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)`.  

- **PID Control**  
  Closed-loop feedback ensures smooth, jitter-free motion of motors and servos.

- **Digital Twin Simulation**  
  Full system modeled in **CoppeliaSim (V-REP)** for testing, tuning, and validation before hardware deployment.

## 📐 System Architecture

### 1. Kinematics & Control
The arm uses **Inverse Kinematics** to calculate joint angles for a desired end-effector position:

\[
\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_6 = f^{-1}(x, y, z, \text{roll}, \text{pitch}, \text{yaw})
\]

### 2. Mobile Base
The **4-wheel Mecanum setup** enables omnidirectional movement:

- **Forward/Backward:** All wheels rotate in the same direction  
- **Strafe (Lateral):** Wheels rotate in opposing "X" patterns  
- **Rotation (Yaw):** Wheels rotate to turn in place  

### 3. Simulation (CoppeliaSim)
Before assembling the physical robot, the system was tested virtually to:

- Verify workspace reach and obstacle handling  
- Tune PID constants safely  
- Validate IK solver accuracy
